    "posts"  :    "No! Veganism is not expensive. While there are plenty of nonvegans ready to tell you otherwise, this is largely due to the myth that vegans are eating processed soy versions of what everyone else eats. In fact, vegans survive mainly on beans, rice, pasta, fruits, and vegetables--the cheapest ingredients on earth. This myth is also perpetuated by specialty vegan restaurants with either the same processed ingredients or high quality prepared dishes. But is this really any different from other specialty restaurants? Veganism is actually easy, even on a college student's budget. Ridiculously Easy Lunchbox Enchilada anyone? If you're not a fan of recipes, look into prepared thai and indian foods, which are often vegan or can be made so very easily. See our recipes.",
