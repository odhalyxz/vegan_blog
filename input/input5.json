    "posts"  :    "Like us, the animals we use for food, clothing, labor, etc. are sentient. They feel pain, fear violence and are highly aware of the world around them. While we can draw lines between some intellectual differences of humans and other animals, all sentient beings have nerves and a brain. That is, a system to consciously understand impulses like touch, pain, and sight in a nervous system. Whether it be a human, an ape, a cat, or a gerbil, no sentient being has “better” or more advanced nerves. The animals we use for enjoyment and convenience have families, desires, and personalities. They taste food, enjoy the company of others, and value many of the qualities of life we as humans hold sacred in the experience of living. So while we may have some very different cognitive abilities, what we take from animals by reducing them to our things is as devastating to them as it is would be to us.",
