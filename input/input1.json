In reality, vegans eat everything non-vegans eat, but without the animal products and likely with more variety from special foods.Common vegan dishes include stir fry, pasta, rice and beans, chana masala, cucumber-avocado sushi, pad thai, quinoa, pizza, pancakes, french toast, waffles, veggie burgers, chili, soups, tacos, burritos, casseroles, stew, sandwiches, cookies, non-dairy ice-cream, cakes, pies, etc.",
